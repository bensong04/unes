# Control for testing extra cycles due to crossing page boundaries.
LDX,I 02 # load 2 into X
LDA,I 2F # load 47 into A
STA,AX 88 00 # store 47 to $008A
# this should hopefully cause an extra cycle
# since we changed pages from 00 to 01
DEC,A 8A 00 
LDA,A 8A 00 # verify 47 was stored in the right place
